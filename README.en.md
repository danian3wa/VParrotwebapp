The Auto Repair Vincent Parrot project is a web application created for an evaluation during training.

## Features

Business manager Vincent Parrot has an administrator account that allows him to manage user accounts for employees (creation, modification, viewing, deletion), manage changes to the repair services section on the home page (creation, modification, visualization, deletion), to manage changes to the opening/closing schedule of the auto repair shop present in each page of the website in the footer of the page.

The website clearly and concisely displays the various car repair services offered by the auto repair shop on the homepage.

The website presents used vehicles available for sale, with photos, detailed descriptions and technical information.

A system of filters facilitates the search for vehicles by adjusting the results according to a price range, number of kilometers traveled or year of registration.

Only employees have the ability to: add, modify, view and delete used cars offered for sale on the website.

Employees have the ability to: add, edit, view, delete testimonials as well as moderate visitor testimonials to avoid inappropriate or offensive content before posting these testimonials on the home page.

The connection to the space dedicated to the administration is done via an e-mail address and a password from the same connection form for both types of users.

Visitors to the website have the option of contacting the garage at any time, by telephone or by filling out an online contact form.

Contact information, including the form, is also visible at the bottom of each used vehicle ad with the subject of the form automatically adjusted based on the title of the vehicle ad.

In order to use a MySQL database you should enable the driver in php.ini on your device if it's not already enabled.
Uncomment "extension=php_pdo_mysql.dll" in your php.ini file

After configuring the work environment you can proceed to installing the necessary components. You need to open the cloned project in your IDE. In the terminal of your IDE you must go to the folder of the newly created project after the cloning if it is not already the case:

```bash
cd VParrotwebapp
```

With this command, in the terminal you install the dependencies of the project present in [composer.json](composer.json):

```bash
composer install
```

If composer is not installed on your work environment, you will find at this address information allowing you to install it:

- [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

With this command, in the terminal you install the dependencies of the project present in [yarn.lock](yarn.lock):

```bash
yarn
```

If yarn is not installed on your work environment, you will find information at this address allowing you to install it:

- [https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

If node.js is not installed on your work environment, you will find information at this address allowing you to install it:

- [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

In the file [.env](.env) we must define the information concerning the access to the database. 'mysql' -> for the type of database, 'root' -> for the user, without password in local network, '127.0.0.1:3306' -> the IP address and the port number, 'bdparrot' -> the database name, '10.4.28-MariaDB' -> server version and type, 'utf8mb4' -> for character encoding type.

     DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:@127.0.0.1:3306/bdparrot?serverVersion=10.4.28-MariaDB&charset=utf8mb4"

You must start the Apache Web Server and MySQL Database servers in the XAMPP application in the Manage Servers section

With this command, in the terminal of your IDE, you create the bdparrot database

```bash
symfony console doctrine:database:create
```

With this command, in the terminal you create the migration of entities:

```bash
symfony console make:migration
```

With this command, in the terminal, you perform the migration to the database:

```bash
symfony console doctrine:migration:migrate
```

With this command, in the terminal of your IDE, you install certificates to be able to browse in https:

```bash
symfony server:ca:install
```

You can open phpMyAdmin in your browser to view the new database.
[http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin/index.php?route=/](http://127.0.0.1/phpmyadmin/index.php?route=/)

It is necessary to insert in the database in the employes table an employee with the roles = ["ROLE_ADMIN"] and a hashed password for Vincent Parrot.

With this command, in your IDE's terminal, you can hash a password:

```bash
symfony console security:hash-password
```

Symfony returns the hashed password to you, you must copy it.

In phpMyAdmin in dbparrot database, in employee table in sql tab, you need to insert employee replacing \_hash_password\_ with the password you copied, you can replace admin@gmail.com by an e-mail address of your choice, it will serve as the login ID for the Parrot Vincent administrator.

```bash
INSERT INTO `employes` (`id`, `nom`, `prenom`, `email`, `roles`, `password`) VALUES
(1, 'Parrot', 'Vincent', 'admin@gmail.com', '[\"ROLE_ADMIN\"]', '_hash_password_');
```

The $roles attribute of the [Employes](/src/Entity/Employes.php) entity is initialized with the value ["ROLE_EMPLOYE"], so each time an Employee is created, the role is predefined and it cannot be changed in the create a new employee section by the administrator. The change can only be made in the database via phpMyAdmin.

At the time of connection according to the role, the user is redirected to the administration space concerning him.

Regarding the sending of data from contact forms, the application uses the sending of e-mails. These data are not saved in the database.

To do this, you must have a Gmail address, with [Two-Step Verification Enabled](https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification) on the account and add a [ security key for the app](https://myaccount.google.com/two-step-verification/security-keys).

Then in the [.env](.env) file at MAILER_DSN=gmail://USERNAME:PASSWORD@default you must replace the USERNAME with your Gmail username and the PASSWORD with the security key that you have created.

In the files [ContactController.php](/src/Controller/ContactController.php) line number 30 and [OccasionsPageController.php](/src/Controller/OccasionsPageController.php) line 99 you must replace test@gmail.com with your e-mail address.

With this command, in the terminal of your IDE, you start the development server:

```bash
npx encore dev-server --hot
```

With this command, in a new terminal of your IDE, you launch Symfony's internal server in the background:

```bash
symfony serve -d
```

The Symfony server informs you that it is listening at the address https://127.0.0.1:8000
You can open this link in your browser.

You now have the possibility to connect to the administration section with the account created for Vincent PARROT and to add identifiers for employees, the opening/closing schedule of the auto repair shop, the car repair services offered by the auto repair shop.

By logging in with an employee ID you will be able to add used cars for sale, add, moderate and approve testimonials.

With this command, in the terminal of your IDE, you stop the Symfony internal server:

```bash
symfony server:stop
```

To stop the development server, use the command Control+C for MacOS or CTRL+C for Windows.
